[Demo]("/demo/demo 20171110.mp4")

## Introduction
This is an improved Qt Version of our [project](https://github.com/zkyf/Kinect-Interaction-Tool). QtKinectInteraction is a tool for interaction with Windows applications by sending keyboard and mouse to the OS. User can specify their own gestures and meanings of the gestures.
Theoretically, this can be used for any Windows application and can achieve some accurate operation, though this may need some practice.

## Features
* Support user-specified gestures and configuration file.
* Support accurate mouse control.

## Requirement
* [Kinect SDK v2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561)
* [Qt 5.9.0](https://www.qt.io/)

## Config File Grammar
Will write this later. It's simple if you read statemachine.cpp.

## In-coming
* More comfortable mouse cursor speed
* Bug fixing
